# A green data center simulator
- This repo contains codes that build a **discrete-time-event-based** datacenter simulator. It can simulate datacenter server power control, task scheduling/running, cooling control, and thermal behavior of the data center.
- The simulator can be extended to build a more sophisticated research prototype involving data center management. For example, we are working on a research project where we aim to leverage reinforcement learning techniques to manage a green datacenter efficiently.
- This CPP project creates Python3 bindings
- C++17 support is needed.
